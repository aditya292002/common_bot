The production of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) involves altering the genetic composition of an organism through the insertion of genes from different organisms. This process is achieved through various techniques such as gene splicing and recombinant DNA technology. GMOs have been created for a variety of purposes ranging from crop improvement to the production of pharmaceuticals. Despite the potential benefits of GMOs, their production and consumption have been met with controversy and concerns over their impact on human health and the environment. Critics argue that GMOs may have long-term health risks and could disrupt natural ecosystems.
