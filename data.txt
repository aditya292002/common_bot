This page in a nutshell: It is somewhat open to debate whether very short articles can become Featured Articles, but consensus tends to be against a set minimum length for FAC.
There has often been discussion about whether very short articles can attain Featured article (FA) status.
Some editors are opposed to short articles at Featured article candidates (FAC). Many bring up fair arguments, such as potential overflow of FACs, lack of reviewers, and loss of quality main page TFAs. Other FAC reviewers argue that any article which meets Wikipedia's notability requirements can become featured.  So, should a 500-word (or less) article be able to make FA?
Featured articles under 400 words have been proposed. WP:GA was initially designed for such articles, but Wikipedia has appeared to have moved beyond that concept.
Examples[edit]
Some examples of current very short featured articles:
MissingNo., FA, Main Page, 1389 words
New York State Route 373, FA, 1005 words
Hurricane Irene (2005), FA, 793 words
Nico Ditch, FA, 778 words
How Brown Saw the Baseball Game, FA, 693 words
2005 Azores subtropical storm, FA, 666 words

Criteria[edit]
From the featured article criteria:
A featured article exemplifies our very best work and ... It isâ€”
(b) comprehensive: it neglects no major facts or details;
For some article topics, a few hundred words might be enough to spell out all major facts and details, so a short article might be comprehensive. It is not advisable to add material for the sole purpose of making an article longer, as quantity is not the same as quality. This raises the question of whether any valid article could, solely via the efforts of Wikipedia editors working from available sources, attain featured status.
